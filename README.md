llms - Lightweight Python Library for LLM APIs
Overview
llms is a lightweight Python library designed to interact with Large Language Model (LLM) APIs, such as Google Gemini, OpenAI, and others. It provides a simple and unified interface to send prompts, generate responses, and work with different AI models seamlessly.

This library is useful for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts who want to integrate LLM-based capabilities into their Python applications without dealing with complex API configurations.

Features
✅ Unified API Interface - Supports multiple LLM providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI, etc.).
✅ Easy Authentication - Pass API keys directly via environment variables or function parameters.
✅ Flexible Prompting - Send text prompts and receive AI-generated responses.
✅ Lightweight & Fast - Minimal dependencies for quick and efficient execution.
✅ Modular & Extensible - Easily add support for new LLM providers.

Installation
Since llms is not yet published on PyPI, you can install it in the following ways:

1️⃣ Install Locally (From a Directory)
If you have downloaded or cloned the repository, navigate to its folder and install:

In Powershell
pip install -e .
2️⃣ Install Directly from GitHub
If the project is uploaded to GitHub, you can install it via:

In Powershell
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/llms.git
Usage
1️⃣ Import and Initialize
python
Copy
Edit
from llms import LLMSClient

client = LLMSClient(provider="gemini", api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
response = client.generate_text("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)
2️⃣ Using Different Providers
python
Copy
Edit
# OpenAI Example
client = LLMSClient(provider="openai", api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_KEY")
response = client.generate_text("Write a Python script to reverse a string.")
print(response)
Project Structure
Your library should follow a structured format like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
llms/                 # Root project directory
│── llms/             # Main module directory
│   │── __init__.py   # Makes it a package
│   │── llms.py       # Your main module code
